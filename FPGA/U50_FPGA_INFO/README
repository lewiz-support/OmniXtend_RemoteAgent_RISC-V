This folder contains the information about the OmniXtend Endpoint developed for the Xilinx Alveo U50 FPGA board.
This Endpoint's Verilog code version was used in simulation with LeWiz OX-Core
The U50 Endpoint was used in conjunction with LeWiz's RISC-V + OX-Core implemented on the VCU118 Xilinx board.

The entire Endpoint source code and repository can be found at:

https://github.com/westerndigitalcorporation/OmnixtendEndpoint

To test the FPGA implementation of the OX-Core on VCU118 + U50 FPGA boards, the U50 implementation requires 
the "Hello World" program to be loaded into the Endpoint for the remote fetching by the RISC-V CPU on the VCU118
FPGA board. This "Hello World" program and endian conversion tool are at:
